=head1 NAME

parallel - build and execute shell command lines from standard input in parallel

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<parallel> [options] [I<command> [arguments]] [< list_of_arguments]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

GNU B<parallel> is a shell tool for executing jobs in parallel locally
or using remote computers. A job is typically a single command or a
small script that has to be run for each of the lines in the
input. The typical input is a list of files, a list of hosts, a list
of users, a list of URLs, or a list of tables.

If you use B<xargs> today you will find GNU B<parallel> very easy to
use as GNU B<parallel> is written to have the same options as
B<xargs>. If you write loops in shell, you will find GNU B<parallel>
may be able to replace most of the loops and make them run faster by
running several jobs in parallel. If you use B<ppss> or B<pexec> you will find
GNU B<parallel> will often make the command easier to read.

GNU B<parallel> makes sure output from the commands is the same output as
you would get had you run the commands sequentially. This makes it
possible to use output from GNU B<parallel> as input for other programs.

For each line of input GNU B<parallel> will execute I<command> with
the line as arguments. If no I<command> is given, the line of input is
executed. Several lines will be run in parallel. GNU B<parallel> can
often be used as a substitute for B<xargs> or B<cat | bash>.

Before looking at the options you may want to check out the examples
after the list of options. That will give you an idea of what GNU
B<parallel> is capable of.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 9

=item I<command>

Command to execute.  If I<command> or the following arguments contain
{} every instance will be substituted with the input line. Setting a
command also invokes B<-f>.

If I<command> is given, GNU B<parallel> will behave similar to B<xargs>. If
I<command> is not given GNU B<parallel> will behave similar to B<cat | sh>.


=item B<{}>

Input line. This is the default replacement string and will normally
be used for putting the argument in the command line. It can be
changed with B<-I>.


=item B<{.}>

Input line without extension. This is a specialized replacement string
with the extension removed. If the input line contains B<.> after the
last B</> the last B<.> till the end of the string will be removed and
B<{.}> will be replaced with the remaining. E.g. I<foo.jpg> becomes
I<foo>, I<subdir/foo.jpg> becomes I<subdir/foo>, I<sub.dir/foo.jpg>
becomes I<sub.dir/foo>, I<sub.dir/bar> remains I<sub.dir/bar>. If the
input line does not contain B<.> it will remain unchanged.

B<{.}> can be used the same places as B<{}>. The replacement string
B<{.}> can be changed with B<-U>.


=item B<--null>

=item B<-0>

Use NUL as delimiter.  Normally input lines will end in \n
(newline). If they end in \0 (NUL), then use this option. It is useful
for processing arguments that may contain \n (newline).


=item B<--arg-file> I<input-file>

=item B<-a> I<input-file>

Read items from the file I<input-file> instead of standard input.  If
you use this option, stdin is given to the first process run.
Otherwise, stdin is redirected from /dev/null.


=item B<--basefile> I<file> (beta testing)

=item B<-B> I<file> (beta testing)

I<file> will be transferred to each sshlogin before a jobs is
started. It will be removed if B<--cleanup> is active. The file may be
a script to run or some common base data needed for the jobs.
Multiple B<-B> can be specified to transfer more basefiles. The
I<file> will be transferred the same way as B<--transfer>.


=item B<--cleanup>

Remove transferred files. B<--cleanup> will remove the transferred files
on the remote server after processing is done.

  find log -name '*gz' | parallel \
    --sshlogin server.example.com --transfer --return {.}.bz2 \
    --cleanup "zcat {} | bzip -9 >{.}.bz2"

With B<--transfer> the file transferred to the remote server will be
removed on the remote server.  Directories created will not be removed
- even if they are empty.

With B<--return> the file transferred from the remote server will be
removed on the remote server.  Directories created will not be removed
- even if they are empty.

B<--cleanup> is ignored when not used with B<--transfer> or B<--return>.


=item B<--command>

=item B<-c>

Line is a command.  The input line contains more than one argument or
the input line needs to be evaluated by the shell. This is the default
if I<command> is not set. Can be reversed with B<-f>.


=item B<--delimiter> I<delim>

=item B<-d> I<delim>

Input items are terminated by the specified character.  Quotes and
backslash are not special; every character in the input is taken
literally.  Disables the end-of-file string, which is treated like any
other argument.  This can be used when the input consists of simply
newline-separated items, although it is almost always better to design
your program to use --null where this is possible.  The specified
delimiter may be a single character, a C-style character escape such
as \n, or an octal or hexadecimal escape code.  Octal and
hexadecimal escape codes are understood as for the printf command.
Multibyte characters are not supported.

=item B<-E> I<eof-str>

Set the end of file string to eof-str.  If the end of file string
occurs as a line of input, the rest of the input is ignored.  If
neither B<-E> nor B<-e> is used, no end of file string is used.


=item B<--eof>[=I<eof-str>]

=item B<-e>[I<eof-str>]

This option is a synonym for the B<-E> option.  Use B<-E> instead,
because it is POSIX compliant for B<xargs> while this option is not.
If I<eof-str> is omitted, there is no end of file string.  If neither
B<-E> nor B<-e> is used, no end of file string is used.


=item B<--eta> (beta testing)

Show the estimated number of seconds before finishing. This forces GNU
B<parallel> to read all jobs before starting to find the number of
jobs. GNU B<parallel> normally only reads the next job to run.
Implies B<--progress>.


=item B<--file>

=item B<-f>

Line is a filename.  The input line contains a filename that will be
quoted so it is not evaluated by the shell. This is the default if
I<command> is set. Can be reversed with B<-c>.


=item B<--group>

=item B<-g>

Group output.  Output from each jobs is grouped together and is only
printed when the command is finished. STDERR first followed by STDOUT.
B<-g> is the default. Can be reversed with B<-u>.

=item B<--help>

=item B<-h>

Print a summary of the options to GNU B<parallel> and exit.


=item B<--halt-on-error> <0|1|2> (beta testing)

=item B<-H> <0|1|2> (beta testing)

=over 3

=item 0

Do not halt if a job fails. Exit status will be the number of jobs
failed. This is the default.

=item 1

Do not start new jobs if a job fails, but complete the running jobs
including cleanup. The exit status will be the exit status from the
last failing job.

=item 2

Kill off all jobs immediately and exit without cleanup. The exit
status will be the exit status from the failing job.

=back


=item B<-I> I<replace-str>

Use the replacement string I<replace-str> instead of {}.


=item B<--replace>[=I<replace-str>]

=item B<-i>[I<replace-str>]

This option is a synonym for B<-I>I<replace-str> if I<replace-str> is
specified, and for B<-I>{} otherwise.  This option is deprecated;
use B<-I> instead.


=item B<--jobs> I<N>

=item B<-j> I<N>

=item B<--max-procs> I<N>

=item B<-P> I<N>

Run up to N jobs in parallel.  0 means as many as possible. Default is 9.


=item B<--jobs> I<+N>

=item B<-j> I<+N>

=item B<--max-procs> I<+N>

=item B<-P> I<+N>

Add N to the number of CPU cores.  Run this many jobs in parallel. For
compute intensive jobs B<-j> +0 is useful as it will run
number-of-cpu-cores jobs in parallel. See also
B<--use-cpus-instead-of-cores>.


=item B<--jobs> I<-N>

=item B<-j> I<-N>

=item B<--max-procs> I<-N>

=item B<-P> I<-N>

Subtract N from the number of CPU cores.  Run this many jobs in parallel.
If the evaluated number is less than 1 then 1 will be used.  See also
B<--use-cpus-instead-of-cores>.


=item B<--jobs> I<N>%

=item B<-j> I<N>%

=item B<--max-procs> I<N>%

=item B<-P> I<N>%

Multiply N% with the number of CPU cores.  Run this many jobs in parallel.
If the evaluated number is less than 1 then 1 will be used.  See also
B<--use-cpus-instead-of-cores>.


=item B<--keeporder>

=item B<-k>

Keep sequence of output same as the order of input. If jobs 1 2 3 4
end in the sequence 3 1 4 2 the output will still be 1 2 3 4.


=item B<-L> I<max-lines>

Use at most I<max-lines> nonblank input lines per command line.
Trailing blanks cause an input line to be logically continued on the
next input line.  Implies B<-x>.

Implies B<-X> unless B<-m> is set.


=item B<--max-lines>[=I<max-lines>]

=item B<-l>[I<max-lines>]

Synonym for the B<-L> option.  Unlike B<-L>, the I<max-lines> argument
is optional.  If I<max-lines> is not specified, it defaults to one.
The B<-l> option is deprecated since the POSIX standard specifies
B<-L> instead.

Implies B<-X> unless B<-m> is set.


=item B<--controlmaster> (experimental)

=item B<-M> (experimental)

Use ssh's ControlMaster to make ssh connections faster. Useful if jobs
run remote and are very fast to run. This is disabled for sshlogins
that specify their own ssh command.


=item B<--progress>

Show progress of computations. List the computers involved in the task
with number of CPU cores detected and the max number of jobs to
run. After that show progress for each computer: number of running
jobs, number of completed jobs, and percentage of all jobs done by
this computer. The percentage will only be available after all jobs
have been scheduled as GNU B<parallel> only read the next job when
ready to schedule it - this is to avoid wasting time and memory by
reading everything at startup.

By sending GNU B<parallel> SIGUSR2 you can toggle turning on/off
B<--progress> on a running GNU B<parallel> process.


=item B<--max-args>=I<max-args>

=item B<-n> I<max-args>

Use at most I<max-args> arguments per command line.  Fewer than
I<max-args> arguments will be used if the size (see the B<-s> option)
is exceeded, unless the B<-x> option is given, in which case
GNU B<parallel> will exit.

Implies B<-X> unless B<-m> is set.


=item B<--max-line-length-allowed>

Print the maximal number characters allowed on the command line and
exit (used by GNU B<parallel> itself to determine the line length
on remote computers).


=item B<--number-of-cpus>

Print the number of physical CPUs and exit (used by GNU B<parallel>
itself to determine the number of physical CPUs on remote computers).


=item B<--number-of-cores>

Print the number of CPU cores and exit (used by GNU B<parallel> itself
to determine the number of CPU cores on remote computers).


=item B<--interactive>

=item B<-p>

Prompt the user about whether to run each command line and read a line
from the terminal.  Only run the command line if the response starts
with 'y' or 'Y'.  Implies B<-t>.


=item B<--quote>

=item B<-q>

Quote I<command>.  This will quote the command line so special
characters are not interpreted by the shell. See the section
QUOTING. Most people will never need this.  Quoting is disabled by
default.


=item B<--no-run-if-empty>

=item B<-r>

If the standard input only contains whitespace, do not run the command.

=item B<--return> I<filename>

Transfer files from remote servers. B<--return> is used with
B<--sshlogin> when the arguments are files on the remote servers. When
processing is done the file I<filename> will be transferred
from the remote server using B<rsync> and will be put relative to
the default login dir. E.g.

  echo foo/bar.txt | parallel \
    --sshlogin server.example.com --return {.}.out touch {.}.out

This will transfer the file I<$HOME/foo/bar.out> from the server
I<server.example.com> to the file I<foo/bar.out> after running
B<touch foo/bar.out> on I<server.example.com>.

  echo /tmp/foo/bar.txt | parallel \
    --sshlogin server.example.com --return {.}.out touch {.}.out

This will transfer the file I</tmp/foo/bar.out> from the server
I<server.example.com> to the file I</tmp/foo/bar.out> after running
B<touch /tmp/foo/bar.out> on I<server.example.com>.

Multiple files can be transferred by repeating the options multiple
times:

  echo /tmp/foo/bar.txt | \
    parallel --sshlogin server.example.com \
    --return {.}.out --return {.}.out2 touch {.}.out {.}.out2

B<--return> is often used with B<--transfer> and B<--cleanup>.

B<--return> is ignored when used with B<--sshlogin :> or when not used
with B<--sshlogin>.


=item B<--max-chars>=I<max-chars>

=item B<-s> I<max-chars>

Use at most I<max-chars> characters per command line, including the
command and initial-arguments and the terminating nulls at the ends of
the argument strings.  The largest allowed value is system-dependent,
and is calculated as the argument length limit for exec, less the size
of your environment.  The default value is the maximum.

Implies B<-X> unless B<-m> is set.


=item B<--show-limits>

Display the limits on the command-line length which are imposed by the
operating system and the B<-s> option.  Pipe the input from /dev/null
(and perhaps specify --no-run-if-empty) if you don't want GNU B<parallel>
to do anything.


=item B<-S> I<[ncpu/]sshlogin[,[ncpu/]sshlogin[,...]]> (beta testing)

=item B<--sshlogin> I<[ncpu/]sshlogin[,[ncpu/]sshlogin[,...]]> (beta testing)

Distribute jobs to remote servers. The jobs will be run on a list of
remote servers.  GNU B<parallel> will determine the number of CPU
cores on the remote servers and run the number of jobs as specified by
B<-j>.  If the number I<ncpu> is given GNU B<parallel> will use this
number for number of CPU cores on the host. Normally I<ncpu> will not
be needed.

An I<sshlogin> is of the form:

  [sshcommand [options]][username@]hostname

The sshlogin must not require a password.

The sshlogin ':' is special, it means 'no ssh' and will therefore run
on the local computer.

To specify more sshlogins separate the sshlogins by comma or repeat
the options multiple times.

For examples: see B<--sshloginfile>.

The remote host must have GNU B<parallel> installed.

B<--sshlogin> is known to cause problems with B<-m> and B<-X>.


=item B<--sshloginfile> I<filename> (beta testing)

File with sshlogins. The file consists of sshlogins on separate
lines. Empty lines and lines starting with '#' are ignored. Example:

  server.example.com
  username@server2.example.com
  8/my-8-core-server.example.com
  2/my_other_username@my-dualcore.example.net
  # This server has SSH running on port 2222
  ssh -p 2222 server.example.net
  4/ssh -p 2222 quadserver.example.net
  # Use a different ssh program
  myssh -p 2222 -l myusername hexacpu.example.net
  # Use a different ssh program with default number of cores
  //usr/local/bin/myssh -p 2222 -l myusername hexacpu.example.net
  # Use a different ssh program with 6 cores
  6//usr/local/bin/myssh -p 2222 -l myusername hexacpu.example.net
  # Assume 16 cores on the local computer
  16/:

When using a different ssh program the last argument must be the hostname.


=item B<--silent>

Silent.  The job to be run will not be printed. This is the default.
Can be reversed with B<-v>.


=item B<--verbose>

=item B<-t>

Print the command line on the standard error output before executing
it.

See also B<-v>.


=item B<--transfer>

Transfer files to remote servers. B<--transfer> is used with
B<--sshlogin> when the arguments are files and should be transferred to
the remote servers. The files will be transferred using B<rsync> and
will be put relative to the default login dir. E.g.

  echo foo/bar.txt | parallel \
    --sshlogin server.example.com --transfer wc

This will transfer the file I<foo/bar.txt> to the server
I<server.example.com> to the file I<$HOME/foo/bar.txt> before running
B<wc foo/bar.txt> on I<server.example.com>.

  echo /tmp/foo/bar.txt | parallel \
    --sshlogin server.example.com --transfer wc

This will transfer the file I<foo/bar.txt> to the server
I<server.example.com> to the file I</tmp/foo/bar.txt> before running
B<wc /tmp/foo/bar.txt> on I<server.example.com>.

B<--transfer> is often used with B<--return> and B<--cleanup>.

B<--transfer> is ignored when used with B<--sshlogin :> or when not used with B<--sshlogin>.


=item B<--trc> I<filename>

Transfer, Return, Cleanup. Short hand for:

B<--transfer> B<--return> I<filename> B<--cleanup>


=item B<--ungroup>

=item B<-u>

Ungroup output.  Output is printed as soon as possible. This may cause
output from different commands to be mixed. GNU B<parallel> runs
faster with B<-u>. Can be reversed with B<-g>.


=item B<--extensionreplace> I<replace-str>

=item B<-U> I<replace-str>

Use the replacement string I<replace-str> instead of {.} for input line without extension.


=item B<--use-cpus-instead-of-cores>

Count the number of physical CPUs instead of CPU cores. When computing
how many jobs to run in parallel relative to the number of CPU cores
you can ask GNU B<parallel> to instead look at the number of physical
CPUs. This will make sense for computers that have hyperthreading as
two jobs running on one CPU with hyperthreading will run slower than
two jobs running on two physical CPUs. Some multi-core CPUs can run
faster if only one thread is running per physical CPU. Most users will
not need this option.


=item B<-v>

Verbose.  Print the job to be run on STDOUT. Can be reversed with
B<--silent>. See also B<-t>.


=item B<--version>

=item B<-V>

Print the version GNU B<parallel> and exit.


=item B<--xargs>

=item B<-m>

Multiple. Insert as many arguments as the command line length
permits. If B<{}> is not used the arguments will be appended to the
line.  If B<{}> is used multiple times each B<{}> will be replaced
with all the arguments.

Support for B<-m> with B<--sshlogin> is limited and may fail.


=item B<-X>

xargs with context replace. This works like B<-m> except if B<{}> is part
of a word (like I<pic{}.jpg>) then the whole word will be
repeated. Normally B<-X> will do the right thing, whereas B<-m> can
give surprising results if B<{}> is used as part of a word.

Support for B<-X> with B<--sshlogin> is limited and may fail.


=item B<--exit>

=item B<-x>

Exit if the size (see the B<-s> option) is exceeded.


=back

=head1 EXAMPLE: Working as xargs -n1. Argument appending

GNU B<parallel> can work similar to B<xargs -n1>.

To compress all html files using B<gzip> run:

B<find . -name '*.html' | parallel gzip>


=head1 EXAMPLE: Inserting multiple arguments

When moving a lot of files like this: B<mv * destdir> you will
sometimes get the error:

B<bash: /bin/mv: Argument list too long>

because there are too many files. You can instead do:

B<ls | parallel mv {} destdir>

This will run B<mv> for each file. It can be done faster if B<mv> gets
as many arguments that will fit on the line:

B<ls | parallel -m mv {} destdir>


=head1 EXAMPLE: Context replace

To remove the files I<pict0000.jpg> .. I<pict9999.jpg> you could do:

B<seq -f %04g 0 9999 | parallel rm pict{}.jpg>

You could also do:

B<seq -f %04g 0 9999 | perl -pe 's/(.*)/pict$1.jpg/' | parallel -m rm>

The first will run B<rm> 10000 times, while the last will only run
B<rm> as many times needed to keep the command line length short
enough to avoid B<Argument list too long> (it typically runs 1-2 times).

You could also run:

B<seq -f %04g 0 9999 | parallel -X rm pict{}.jpg>

This will also only run B<rm> as many times needed to keep the command
line length short enough.


=head1 EXAMPLE: Compute intensive jobs and substitution

If ImageMagick is installed this will generate a thumbnail of a jpg
file:

B<convert -geometry 120 foo.jpg thumb_foo.jpg>

If the system has more than 1 CPU core it can be run with
number-of-cpu-cores jobs in parallel (B<-j> +0). This will do that for
all jpg files in a directory:

B<ls *.jpg | parallel -j +0 convert -geometry 120 {} thumb_{}>

To do it recursively use B<find>:

B<find . -name '*.jpg' | parallel -j +0 convert -geometry 120 {} {}_thumb.jpg>

Notice how the argument has to start with B<{}> as B<{}> will include path
(e.g. running B<convert -geometry 120 ./foo/bar.jpg
thumb_./foo/bar.jpg> would clearly be wrong). The command will
generate files like ./foo/bar.jpg_thumb.jpg.

Use B<{.}> to avoid the extra .jpg in the file name. This command will
make files like ./foo/bar_thumb.jpg:

B<find . -name '*.jpg' | parallel -j +0 convert -geometry 120 {} {.}_thumb.jpg>


=head1 EXAMPLE: Substitution and redirection

This will generate an uncompressed version of .gz-files next to the .gz-file:

B<ls *.gz | parallel zcat {} ">>B<"{.}>

Quoting of > is necessary to postpone the redirection. Another
solution is to quote the whole command:

B<ls *.gz | parallel "zcat {} >>B<{.}">

Other special shell charaters (such as * ; $ > < | >> <<) also needs
to be put in quotes, as they may otherwise be interpreted by the shell
and not given to GNU B<parallel>.

=head1 EXAMPLE: Composed commands

A job can consist of several commands. This will print the number of
files in each directory:

B<ls | parallel 'echo -n {}" "; ls {}|wc -l'>

To put the output in a file called <name>.dir:

B<ls | parallel '(echo -n {}" "; ls {}|wc -l) >> B<{}.dir'>


=head1 EXAMPLE: Removing file extension when processing files

When processing files removing the file extension using B<{.}> is
often useful.

Create a directory for each zip-file and unzip it in that dir:

B<ls *zip | parallel 'mkdir {.}; cd {.}; unzip ../{}'>

Recompress all .gz files in current directory using B<bzip2> running 1
job per CPU core in parallel:

B<ls *.gz | parallel -j+0 "zcat {} | bzip2 >>B<{.}.bz2 && rm {}">


=head1 EXAMPLE: Removing two file extensions when processing files and
calling GNU Parallel from itself

If you have directory with tar.gz files and want these extracted in
the corresponding dir (e.g foo.tar.gz will be extracted in the dir
foo) you can do:

B<ls *.tar.gz| parallel -U /// 'echo ///|parallel "mkdir -p {.} ; tar -C {.} -xf {.}.tar.gz"'>


=head1 EXAMPLE: Rewriting a for-loop and a while-loop

for-loops like this:

  (for x in `cat list` ; do
    do_something $x
  done) | process_output

and while-loops like this:

  cat list | (while read x ; do
    do_something $x
  done) | process_output

can be written like this:

B<cat list | parallel do_something | process_output>

If the processing requires more steps the for-loop like this:

 (for x in `cat list` ; do
   no_extension=${x%.png};
   do_something $x scale $no_extension.jpg
   do_step2 <$x $no_extension
 done) | process_output

and while-loops like this:

 cat list | (while read x ; do
   no_extension=${x%.png};
   do_something $x scale $no_extension.jpg
   do_step2 <$x $no_extension
 done) | process_output

can be written like this:

B<cat list | parallel "do_something {} scale {.}.jpg ; do_step2 <{} {.}" | process_output>


=head1 EXAMPLE: Group output lines

When runnning jobs that output data, you often do not want the output
of multiple jobs to run together. GNU B<parallel> defaults to grouping the
output of each job, so the output is printed when the job finishes. If
you want the output to be printed while the job is running you can use
B<-u>.

Compare the output of:

B<(echo foss.org.my; echo debian.org; echo freenetproject.org) | parallel traceroute>

to the output of:

B<(echo foss.org.my; echo debian.org; echo freenetproject.org) | parallel -u traceroute>


=head1 EXAMPLE: Keep order of output same as order of input

Normally the output of a job will be printed as soon as it
completes. Sometimes you want the order of the output to remain the
same as the order of the input. This is often important, if the output
is used as input for another system. B<-k> will make sure the order of
output will be in the same order as input even if later jobs end
before earlier jobs.

Append a string to every line in a text file:

B<cat textfile | parallel -k echo {} append_string>

If you remove B<-k> some of the lines may come out in the wrong order.

Another example is B<traceroute>:

B<(echo foss.org.my; echo debian.org; echo freenetproject.org) | parallel traceroute>

will give traceroute of foss.org.my, debian.org and
freenetproject.org, but it will be sorted according to which job
completed first.

To keep the order the same as input run:

B<(echo foss.org.my; echo debian.org; echo freenetproject.org) | parallel -k traceroute>

This will make sure the traceroute to foss.org.my will be printed
first.


=head1 EXAMPLE: Parallel grep

B<grep -r> greps recursively through directories. On multicore CPUs
GNU B<parallel> can often speed this up.

find . -type f | parallel -k -j150% -n 1000 -m grep -H -n STRING {}

This will run 1.5 job per core, and give 1000 arguments to B<grep>.


=head1 EXAMPLE: Using remote computers

To run commands on a remote computer SSH needs to be set up and you
must be able to login without entering a password (B<ssh-agent> may be
handy).

To run B<echo> on B<server.example.com>:

  seq 1 10 | parallel --sshlogin server.example.com echo

To run commands on more than one remote computer run:

  seq 1 10 | parallel --sshlogin server.example.com,server2.example.net echo

Or:

  seq 1 10 | parallel --sshlogin server.example.com \
    --sshlogin server2.example.net echo

If the login username is I<foo> on I<server2.example.net> use:

  seq 1 10 | parallel --sshlogin server.example.com \
    --sshlogin foo@server2.example.net echo

To distribute the commands to a list of computers, make a file
I<mycomputers> with all the computers:

  server.example.com
  foo@server2.example.com
  server3.example.com

Then run:

  seq 1 10 | parallel --sshloginfile mycomputers echo

To include the local computer add the special sshlogin ':' to the list:

  server.example.com
  foo@server2.example.com
  server3.example.com
  :

GNU B<parallel> will try to determine the number of CPU cores on each
of the remote computers, so B<-j+0> will run one job per CPU core -
even if the remote computers do not have the same number of CPU cores.

If the number of CPU cores on the remote servers is not identified
correctly the number of CPU cores can be added in front. Here the
server has 8 CPU cores.

  seq 1 10 | parallel --sshlogin 8/server.example.com echo


=head1 EXAMPLE: Transferring of files

To recompress gzipped files with B<bzip2> using a remote server run:

  find logs/ -name '*.gz' | \
    parallel --sshlogin server.example.com \
    --transfer "zcat {} | bzip2 -9 >{.}.bz2"

This will list the .gz-files in the I<logs> directory and all
directories below. Then it will transfer the files to
I<server.example.com> to the corresponding directory in
I<$HOME/logs>. On I<server.example.com> the file will be recompressed
using B<zcat> and B<bzip2> resulting in the corresponding file with
I<.gz> replaced with I<.bz2>.

If you want the resulting bz2-file to be transferred back to the local
computer add I<--return {.}.bz2>:

  find logs/ -name '*.gz' | \
    parallel --sshlogin server.example.com \
    --transfer --return {.}.bz2 "zcat {} | bzip2 -9 >{.}.bz2"

After the recompressing is done the I<.bz2>-file is transferred back to
the local computer and put next to the original I<.gz>-file.

If you want to delete the transferred files on the remote computer add
I<--cleanup>. This will remove both the file transferred to the remote
computer and the files transferred from the remote computer:

  find logs/ -name '*.gz' | \
    parallel --sshlogin server.example.com \
    --transfer --return {.}.bz2 --cleanup "zcat {} | bzip2 -9 >{.}.bz2"

If you want run on several servers add the servers to I<--sshlogin>
either using ',' or multiple I<--sshlogin>:

  find logs/ -name '*.gz' | \
    parallel --sshlogin server.example.com,server2.example.com \
    --sshlogin server3.example.com \
    --transfer --return {.}.bz2 --cleanup "zcat {} | bzip2 -9 >{.}.bz2"

You can add the local computer using I<--sshlogin :>. This will disable the
removing and transferring for the local computer only:

  find logs/ -name '*.gz' | \
    parallel --sshlogin server.example.com,server2.example.com \
    --sshlogin server3.example.com \
    --sshlogin : \
    --transfer --return {.}.bz2 --cleanup "zcat {} | bzip2 -9 >{.}.bz2"

Often I<--transfer>, I<--return> and I<--cleanup> are used together. They can be
shortened to I<--trc>:

  find logs/ -name '*.gz' | \
    parallel --sshlogin server.example.com,server2.example.com \
    --sshlogin server3.example.com \
    --sshlogin : \
    --trc {.}.bz2 "zcat {} | bzip2 -9 >{.}.bz2"

With the file I<mycomputers> containing the list of computers it becomes:

  find logs/ -name '*.gz' | parallel --sshloginfile mycomputers \
    --trc {.}.bz2 "zcat {} | bzip2 -9 >{.}.bz2"


=head1 EXAMPLE: Working as cat | sh. Ressource inexpensive jobs and evaluation

GNU B<parallel> can work similar to B<cat | sh>.

A ressource inexpensive job is a job that takes very little CPU, disk
I/O and network I/O. Ping is an example of a ressource inexpensive
job. wget is too - if the webpages are small.

The content of the file jobs_to_run:

  ping -c 1 10.0.0.1
  wget http://status-server/status.cgi?ip=10.0.0.1
  ping -c 1 10.0.0.2
  wget http://status-server/status.cgi?ip=10.0.0.2
  ...
  ping -c 1 10.0.0.255
  wget http://status-server/status.cgi?ip=10.0.0.255

To run 100 processes simultaneously do:

B<parallel -j 100 < jobs_to_run>

As there is not a I<command> the option B<-c> is default because the
jobs needs to be evaluated by the shell.


=head1 QUOTING

For more advanced use quoting may be an issue. The following will
print the filename for each line that has exactly 2 columns:

B<perl -ne '/^\S+\s+\S+$/ and print $ARGV,"\n"' file>

This can be done by GNU B<parallel> using:

B<ls | parallel "perl -ne '/^\\S+\\s+\\S+$/ and print \$ARGV,\"\\n\"'">

Notice how \'s, "'s, and $'s needs to be quoted. GNU B<parallel> can do
the quoting by using option B<-q>:

B<ls | parallel -q  perl -ne '/^\S+\s+\S+$/ and print $ARGV,"\n"'>

However, this means you cannot make the shell interpret special
characters. For example this B<will not work>:

B<ls *.gz | parallel -q "zcat {} >>B<{.}">

B<ls *.gz | parallel -q "zcat {} | bzip2 >>B<{.}.bz2">

because > and | need to be interpreted by the shell.

If you get errors like:

B<sh: -c: line 0: syntax error near unexpected token>

then you might try using B<-q>.

If you are using B<bash> process substitution like B<<(cat foo)> then
you may try B<-q> and prepending I<command> with B<bash -c>:

B<ls | parallel -q bash -c 'wc -c <(echo {})'>

Or for substituting output:

B<ls | parallel -q bash -c 'tar c {} | tee >>B<(gzip >>B<{}.tar.gz) | bzip2 >>B<{}.tar.bz2'>

B<Conclusion>: To avoid dealing with the quoting problems it may be
easier just to write a small script and have GNU B<parallel> call that
script.


=head1 LIST RUNNING JOBS

If you want a list of the jobs currently running you can run:

B<killall -USR1 parallel>

GNU B<parallel> will then print the currently running jobs on STDERR.


=head1 COMPLETE RUNNING JOBS BUT DO NOT START NEW JOBS

If you regret starting a lot of jobs you can simply break GNU B<parallel>,
but if you want to make sure you do not have halfcompleted jobs you
should send the signal B<SIGTERM> to GNU B<parallel>:

B<killall -TERM parallel>

This will tell GNU B<parallel> to not start any new jobs, but wait until
the currently running jobs are finished before exiting.


=head1 ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

=over 9

=item $PARALLEL_PID - unimplemented

The environment variable $PARALLEL_PID is set by GNU B<parallel> and
is visible to the jobs started from GNU B<parallel>. This makes it
possible for the jobs to communicate directly to GNU <parallel>.

B<Example:> If each of the jobs tests a solution and one of jobs finds
the solution the job can tell GNU B<parallel> not to start more jobs
by: B<kill -TERM $PARALLEL_PID>. This only works on the local
computer.

=item $PARALLEL

The environment variable $PARALLEL will be used as default options for
GNU B<parallel>. However, because some options take arguments the
options need to be split into groups in which only the last option
takes an argument. Each group of options should be put on a line of its
own.

B<Example:>

B<cat list | parallel -j1 -k -v ls>

can be written as:

B<cat list | PARALLEL="-kvj1" parallel ls>

B<cat list | parallel -j1 -k -v -S"myssh user@server" ls>

can be written as:

B<cat list | PARALLEL="-kvj1>

B<-Smyssh user@server" parallel echo>

Notice the newline in the middle is needed because both B<-S> and
B<-j> take an argument and thus both need to be at the end of a group.

=back

=head1 INIT FILE (RC FILE)

The file ~/.parallelrc will be read if it exists. It should be
formatted like the environment variable $PARALLEL. Lines starting with
'#' will be ignored.


=head1 EXIT STATUS

If B<--halt-on-error> 0 or not specified:

=over 6

=item 0

All jobs ran without error.

=item 1-253

Some of the jobs failed. The exit status gives the number of failed jobs

=item 254

More than 253 jobs failed.

=item 255

Other error.

=back

If B<--halt-on-error> 1 or 2: Exit status of the failing job.


=head1 DIFFERENCES BETWEEN GNU Parallel AND ALTERNATIVES

There are a lot programs with some of the functionality of GNU
B<parallel>. GNU B<parallel> strives to include the best of the
functionality without sacrifying ease of use.


=head2 DIFFERENCES BETWEEN xargs AND GNU Parallel

B<xargs> offer some of the same possibilites as GNU B<parallel>.

B<xargs> deals badly with special characters (such as space, ' and
"). To see the problem try this:

  touch important_file
  touch 'not important_file'
  ls not* | xargs rm
  mkdir -p '12" records'
  ls | xargs rmdir

You can specify B<-0> or B<-d "\n">, but many input generators are not
optimized for using B<NUL> as separator but are optimized for
B<newline> as separator. E.g B<head>, B<tail>, B<awk>, B<ls>, B<echo>,
B<sed>, B<tar -v>, B<perl> (B<-0> and \0 instead of \n), B<locate>
(requires using B<-0>), B<find> (requires using B<-print0>), B<grep>
(requires user to use B<-z> or B<-Z>).

So GNU B<parallel>'s newline separation can be emulated with:

B<cat | xargs -d "\n" -n1 I<command>>

B<xargs> can run a given number of jobs in parallel, but has no
support for running number-of-cpu-cores jobs in parallel.

B<xargs> has no support for grouping the output, therefore output may
run together, e.g. the first half of a line is from one process and
the last half of the line is from another process. The example
B<Parallel grep> cannot be done reliably with B<xargs> because of
this.

B<xargs> has no support for keeping the order of the output, therefore
if running jobs in parallel using B<xargs> the output of the second
job cannot be postponed till the first job is done.

B<xargs> has no support for running jobs on remote computers.

B<xargs> has no support for context replace, so you will have to create the
arguments.

If you use a replace string in B<xargs> (B<-I>) you can not force
B<xargs> to use more than one argument.

Quoting in B<xargs> works like B<-q> in GNU B<parallel>. This means
composed commands and redirection require using B<bash -c>.

B<ls | parallel "wc {} >> B<{}.wc">

becomes

B<ls | xargs -d "\n" -P9 -I {} bash -c "wc {} >>B< {}.wc">

and

B<ls | parallel "echo {}; ls {}|wc">

becomes

B<ls | xargs -d "\n" -P9 -I {} bash -c "echo {}; ls {}|wc">


=head2 DIFFERENCES BETWEEN find -exec AND GNU Parallel

B<find -exec> offer some of the same possibilites as GNU B<parallel>.

B<find -exec> only works on files. So processing other input (such as
hosts or URLs) will require creating these inputs as files. B<find
-exec> has no support for running commands in parallel.


=head2 DIFFERENCES BETWEEN make -j AND GNU Parallel

B<make -j> can run jobs in parallel, but requires a crafted Makefile
to do this. That results in extra quoting to get filename containing
newline to work correctly.

B<make -j> has no support for grouping the output, therefore output
may run together, e.g. the first half of a line is from one process
and the last half of the line is from another process. The example
B<Parallel grep> cannot be done reliably with B<make -j> because of
this.

(Very early versions of GNU Parallel was coincidently implemented
using B<make -j>).


=head2 DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ppss AND GNU Parallel

B<ppss> is also a tool for running jobs in parallel.

The output of B<ppss> is status information and thus not useful for
using as input for another command. The output from the jobs are put
into files.

The argument replace string ($ITEM) cannot be changed. Arguments must
be quoted - thus arguments containing special characters (space '"&!*)
may cause problems. More than one argument is not supported. File
names containing newlines are not processed correctly. When reading
input from a file null cannot be used terminator. B<ppss> needs to
read the whole input file before starting any jobs.

Output and status information is stored in ppss_dir and thus requires
cleanup when completed. If the dir is not removed before running
B<ppss> again it may cause nothing to happen as B<ppss> thinks the
task is already done. GNU B<parallel> will normally not need cleaning
up if running locally and will only need cleaning up if stopped
abnormally and running remote (B<--cleanup> may not complete if
stopped abnormally). The example B<Parallel grep> would require extra
postprocessing if written using B<ppss>.

For remote systems PPSS requires 3 steps: config, deploy, and
start. GNU B<parallel> only requires one step.

=head3 EXAMPLES FROM ppss MANUAL

Here are the examples from B<ppss>'s manual page with the equivalent
using GNU B<parallel>:

./ppss.sh standalone -d /path/to/files -c 'gzip '

find /path/to/files -type f | parallel -j+0 gzip

./ppss.sh standalone -d /path/to/files -c 'cp "$ITEM" /destination/dir '

find /path/to/files -type f | parallel -j+0 cp {} /destination/dir

./ppss.sh standalone -f list-of-urls.txt -c 'wget -q '

parallel -a list-of-urls.txt wget -q

./ppss.sh standalone -f list-of-urls.txt -c 'wget -q "$ITEM"'

parallel -a list-of-urls.txt wget -q {}

./ppss config -C config.cfg -c 'encode.sh ' -d /source/dir -m 192.168.1.100 -u ppss -k ppss-key.key -S ./encode.sh -n nodes.txt -o /some/output/dir --upload --download

./ppss deploy -C config.cfg

./ppss start -C config

# parallel does not use configs. If you want a different username put it in nodes.txt: user@hostname

find source/dir -type f | parallel --sshloginfile nodes.txt --trc {.}.mp3 lame -a {} -o {.}.mp3 --preset standard --quiet

./ppss stop -C config.cfg

killall -TERM parallel

./ppss pause -C config.cfg

Press: CTRL-Z or killall -SIGTSTP parallel

./ppss continue -C config.cfg

Enter: fg or killall -SIGCONT parallel

./ppss.sh status -C config.cfg

killall -SIGUSR1 parallel # Not quite equivalent: Only shows the currently running jobs


=head2 DIFFERENCES BETWEEN pexec AND GNU Parallel

B<pexec> is also a tool for running jobs in parallel.

Here are the examples from B<pexec>'s info page with the equivalent
using parallel:

pexec -o sqrt-%s.dat -p "$(seq 10)" -e NUM -n 4 -c -- \
  'echo "scale=10000;sqrt($NUM)" | bc'

seq 10 | parallel -j4 'echo "scale=10000;sqrt({})" | bc > sqrt-{}.dat'

pexec -p "$(ls myfiles*.ext)" -i %s -o %s.sort -- sort

ls myfiles*.ext | parallel sort {} ">{}.sort"

pexec -f image.list -n auto -e B -u star.log -c -- \
  'fistar $B.fits -f 100 -F id,x,y,flux -o $B.star'

parallel -a image.list -j+0 \
  'fistar {}.fits -f 100 -F id,x,y,flux -o {}.star' 2>star.log

pexec -r *.png -e IMG -c -o - -- \
  'convert $IMG ${IMG%.png}.jpeg ; "echo $IMG: done"'

ls *.png | parallel 'convert {} {.}.jpeg; echo {}: done'

pexec -r *.png -i %s -o %s.jpg -c 'pngtopnm | pnmtojpeg'

ls *.png | parallel 'pngtopnm < {} | pnmtojpeg > {}.jpg'

for p in *.png ; do echo ${p%.png} ; done | \
  pexec -f - -i %s.png -o %s.jpg -c 'pngtopnm | pnmtojpeg'

ls *.png | parallel 'pngtopnm < {} | pnmtojpeg > {.}.jpg'

LIST=$(for p in *.png ; do echo ${p%.png} ; done)
  pexec -r $LIST -i %s.png -o %s.jpg -c 'pngtopnm | pnmtojpeg'

ls *.png | parallel 'pngtopnm < {} | pnmtojpeg > {.}.jpg'

pexec -n 8 -r *.jpg -y unix -e IMG -c \
  'pexec -j -m blockread -d $IMG | \
  jpegtopnm | pnmscale 0.5 | pnmtojpeg | \
  pexec -j -m blockwrite -s th_$IMG'

GNU B<parallel> does not support mutexes directly but uses B<mutex> to
do that.

ls *jpg | parallel -j8 'mutex -m blockread cat {} | jpegtopnm |' \
  'pnmscale 0.5 | pnmtojpeg | mutex -m blockwrite cat > th_{}'


=head2 DIFFERENCES BETWEEN xjobs AND GNU Parallel

B<xjobs> is also a tool for running jobs in parallel. It only supports
running jobs on your local computer.

B<xjobs> deals badly with special characters just like B<xargs>. See
the section B<DIFFERENCES BETWEEN xargs AND GNU Parallel>.

Here are the examples from B<xjobs>'s man page with the equivalent
using GNU B<parallel>:

ls -1 *.zip | xjobs unzip

ls *.zip | parallel unzip

ls -1 *.zip | xjobs -n unzip

ls *.zip | parallel unzip >/dev/null

find . -name '*.bak' | xjobs gzip

find . -name '*.bak' | parallel gzip

ls -1 *.jar | sed 's/\(.*\)/\1 > \1.idx/' | xjobs jar tf

ls *.jar | parallel jar tf {} '>' {}.idx

xjobs -s script

cat script | parallel

mkfifo /var/run/my_named_pipe;
xjobs -s /var/run/my_named_pipe &
echo unzip 1.zip >> /var/run/my_named_pipe;
echo tar cf /backup/myhome.tar /home/me >> /var/run/my_named_pipe

mkfifo /var/run/my_named_pipe;
cat /var/run/my_named_pipe | parallel &
echo unzip 1.zip >> /var/run/my_named_pipe;
echo tar cf /backup/myhome.tar /home/me >> /var/run/my_named_pipe


=head2 DIFFERENCES BETWEEN prll AND GNU parallel

B<prll> is also a tool for running jobs in parallel. It does not
support running jobs on remote computers.

B<prll> encourages using BASH aliases and BASH functions instead of
scripts. GNU B<parallel> will never support running aliases and
functions (see why http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=484296)
but scripts or composed commands work just fine.

B<prll> generates a lot of status information on STDERR which makes it
harder to use the STDERR output of the job directly as input for
another program.

Here is the example from B<prll>'s man page with the equivalent
using GNU B<parallel>:

prll -s 'mogrify -flip $1' *.jpg

ls *.jpg | parallel mogrify -flip


=head2 DIFFERENCES BETWEEN dxargs AND GNU Parallel

B<dxargs> is also a tool for running jobs in parallel.

B<dxargs> does not deal well with more simultaneous jobs than SSHD's
MaxStartup. B<dxargs> is only built for remote run jobs, but does not
support transferring of files.


=head2 DIFFERENCES BETWEEN mdm/middleman AND GNU Parallel

middleman(mdm) is also a tool for running jobs in parallel.

Here are the shellscripts of http://mdm.berlios.de/usage.html ported
to GNU B<parallel>:

B<seq 1 19 | parallel -j+0 buffon -o - | sort -n >>B< result>

B<cat files | parallel -j+0 cmd>


=head1 BUGS

Filenames beginning with '-' can cause some commands to give
unexpected results, as it will often be interpreted as an option.


=head1 REPORTING BUGS
